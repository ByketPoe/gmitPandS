a. What will be printed out when this program is run?
    Nothing will be printed because the print function isn't used, both in the yo() function and in the main code.
b. What would you have to add to the program to get it to print out what the calling the function yo(3) returns?
    Assuming this is to be added to the main program, the invocation of yo(3) would need to be wrapped in a print function. 
    Alternatively, the result can be passed to a variable (result = yo(3)) and the variable can be printed (print(result)).
    Alternatively again, the print function can be used within the yo() function (print(a*2))
