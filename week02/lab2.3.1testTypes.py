# testTypes.py
# The purpose of this program is to demonstrate variables and their types.
# author: Emma Farrell

# Define the variables and assign values to them. 
i = 3 # This is an integer
fl = 3.5 # This is a float
isa = True # This is a Boolean
memo = 'how now Brown Cow' # This is a string
lots = [] # This is a list

# Print the variable name, variable type and the value contained in the variable for all variables defined above. 
print('variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('i', type(i), i))
print('variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('fl', type(fl), fl))
print('variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('isa', type(isa), isa))
print('variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('memo', type(memo), memo))
print('variable {} is of type: {} and value: {}'.format('lots', type(lots), lots))
